<h2>KFL 2023 Draft Standings</h2>
<p>A reminder to how the order is determined the rules are as follows</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your record determines your draft order unless you made the playoffs. The 4 playoff teams have their draft order determined by playoff performance</li>
<li>In the case of a tie record for non-playoff teams, your performance in the consolation round determines seeding. So if two teams tie in record, the team that wins their consolation round game(s) will get the higher draft position.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If the teams with a tie record both win their first round consolation game, it moves on to the second round. If teams with tie records win both conosolation games then the tiebreaker is points for.</li>
</ul>
